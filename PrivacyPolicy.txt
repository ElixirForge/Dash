==Privacy Policy==

Wisam Orabi built the Dashing Pixels app as a Commercial app. This SERVICE is provided by Wisam Orabi and is intended for use as is.
This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to this privacy policy. Third parties such as Google and Unity may collect such information in order to improve the service, to facilitate in-app purchases or to display advertisements; all on behalf of the application. I, Wisam Orabi, do not receive any personal information; the same does not necessarily apply to the third parties mentioned.

--Information Collection and Use--

The app does use third party services and APIs for advertising purposes and to facilitate in-app purchases. The Unity Monetization API, which is Google Play certified has been set up in a way such that it complies with advertising policies regarding children under 13 years old. 
The only information the application itself uses is a unique device ID which is stored in the game's save file in order to prevent the save files from being copied between devices so that app purchases cannot be moved from a paying user's device to a non-paying user's device. 
The application does not require any permissions to access sensors, microphone, camera or any device peripherals that could violate the user's privacy in any way.

--Security--

I value your trust in providing our third parties with potential personal information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

--Links to Other Sites--

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

--Changes to This Privacy Policy--

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
This policy is effective as of 2020-07-13
