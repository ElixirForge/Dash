==Privacy Policy==

Elixir Forge built the Dashing Pixels app as a Commercial app. This SERVICE is provided by Elixir Forge and is intended for use as is.
This page is used to inform visitors regarding Elixir Forge's policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use this Service.
If you choose to use this Service, then you agree to this privacy policy. Third parties such as Google and Unity may collect such information in order to improve the service, to facilitate in-app purchases or to display advertisements; all on behalf of the application. We, Elixir Forge, do not receive any personal information; the same does not necessarily apply to the third parties mentioned.

--Information Collection and Use--

The app does use third party services and APIs for advertising purposes and to facilitate in-app purchases. The Unity Monetization API, which is Google Play certified has been set up in a way such that it complies with advertising policies regarding children under 13 years old. 
The only information the application itself uses is a unique device ID which is stored in the game's save file in order to prevent the save files from being copied between devices so that app purchases cannot be moved from a paying user's device to a non-paying user's device. The application does not require any permissions to access sensors, microphone, camera or any device peripherals that could violate the user's privacy in any way.
